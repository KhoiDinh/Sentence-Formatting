# Sentence-Formatting
Write a program that reads a sentence with up to 100 characters and outputs a sentence with the correct capitalization and spacing. Don’t worry about proper names. Treat a line break as a blank ad multiple spaces should become 1 space. Assume the sentence ends with a period and doesn’t contains any other periods.
